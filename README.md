# arduino_drone

This project will attempt to create a very simple arduino-based brushed drone. The purpose is to experiment with control theory (pid loop) and rf theory (radio control and video).

The project will consist of two elements: ground control station (remote) and the flight controller (fc). Simplicity is the name of the game. Everything in this project should be the bare minimum structure to get the thing to fly.
